# Carbon Footprint Estimator - Regression Model

This project estimates an individual's **weekly carbon footprint (CO₂ kg/week)** using a regression model based on lifestyle choices. It is built as part of an entry-level AI/ML task.

## Dataset used
I used a dataset from kaggle, which includes various features.Actually the assignment said to include diet, transport, and electricity usage, but I searched for many datasets and couldn't find anything like that and if I hadn't given the input myself, it would have been more wrong.So I worked on the remaining features.
- **Sex**
- **Diet type**
- **Transport usage** 
- **Vehicle Monthly Distance Km**
